<p><b>Mayoi:</b> So you're asking m-me to take care of Hokuto-senpai?</p>
<p><b>Tomoya:</b> I'm sorry to ask so suddenly. It turned out that our next location wasn't going to be a day trip.</p>
<p>I can't take Hokuto-senpai to work with me, and the pet shop manager hasn't returned to Japan yet, so...</p>
<p>I'm looking for someone who can take care of him until I return from work...</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> I see. I understand your situation.</p>
<p>Well... I'm very happy that you came to me for help, but...</p>
<p>I really don't think I'm suited to take care of Hokuto-senpai...!</p>
<p>Even when you first got Hokuto-senpai, I mostly spent time in another room so I wouldn't get in your way...</p>
<p>Um, umm... Can't you ask the people in "ANIMALS" for help, like you did before?</p>
<p><b>Tomoya:</b> Well, I tried to ask them. But it looks like everyone already has plans on that day.</p>
<p>They can only be back by the evening...</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> And someone has to take care of Hokuto-senpai until then, right...</p>
<p>(Wh-what should I do? I more or less know how to take care of Hokuto-senpai, since I watched Mashiro-san doing it...)</p>
<p>(Even though I know how to care for him, I don't know if he'll listen to me at all.)</p>
<p>(Nevermind that, if something was to happen to Mashiro-san's precious Hokuto-senpai because I wasn't able to take care of him properly...)</p>

<p><b>Tomoya:</b> ...I'm sorry, Ayase-senpai. I put you in a difficult position by asking something like this so suddenly.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> No, I...</p>
<p><b>Tomoya:</b> Please forget about it. I'll try and ask some other people as well.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> (I've troubled Mashiro-san a lot, not only in the "Dead End Cafe", but also as a roommate...)</p>
<p>(I want to return the favor if I can...)</p>
<p>(After all, he came to me for help. There must have not been anyone else that he could ask.)</p>
<p>I, I got it!</p>
<p><b>Tomoya:</b> Ayase-senpai...?</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> If the members of "ANIMALS" can make it towards the night...</p>
<p>I will accept the responsibility, and take care of Hokuto-senpaii! </p>
<blockquote class="npf_indented"><p><b>Time:</b> The next day</p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Then... Let's get along today, Hokuto-senpai &#9834;</p>
<p>(Since Tomoya-san is off to work, from here on, I have to take great care of him..!)</p>
<p>Uum, Mashiro-san already fed him, so next up...</p>

<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Eek!? Hokuto-senpai cried out suddenly...! What's wrong!?</p>
<p>I'msorryI'msorryy, I know someone like me isn't fit to take care of you!</p>
<p>But please, be a little patient with me...!</p>
<p>Ah, where are you going...! Please waaiiit!</p>

<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> (I'm relieved that my vegetables seem to be growing nicely&#9834;)</p>
<p>(Right. Before I forget, let me send this picture I took to everyone in "Gardenia". Uuh, to attach an image...)</p>
<p>(...Hm? There's a familiar crying sound coming from somewhere.)</p>
<p>(The source of the voice... seems to be Mayoi-san and Tomoya-san's room. That means...)</p>
<p>Mayoi-san, Tomoya-san. It sounds like Hokuto-senpai is crying. Did something happen?</p>
<p>(No answer. I can still hear the crying, but no sound from Mayoi-san or anyone else...)</p>
<p>(I'll have to invite myself in, Mayoi-san!)</p>

<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> This is!? Mayoi-san, are you okay!?</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Uuu...? </p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> Why did you collapse in the room like this!?</p>
<p>Where is Tomoya-san!? What exactly happened here!?</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> ...Ah, God must be so merciful as to allow even a person such as myself to receive a final call of fate...</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> Please hang on! This isn't a final call of anything!</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Uuu... I'm sorry to make you worry like this...</p>
<p>I was so deeply focused on taking good care of Hokuto-senpai, I forgot to take care of myself, even to eat...</p>
<p>But I never thought that I'd pass out... If Tatsumi-san didn't find me, who knows what would have become of me...</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> You're exaggarating. However, I'm relieved that you seem better now.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> You even made toast for me. Thank you so much, really.</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> It's Hokuto-senpai that you should thank. I was alerted to the situation thanks to his cries.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> I-is that so. Thank you, Hokuto-sen--</p>
<p>Eek!? Why are you screaming so much? Did, did I do something to offend you...?</p>
<p>Uuu, you really won't listen to me...</p>
<p>What do I do... At this rate, we won't even make it until everyone from "ANIMALS" arrives.</p>
<figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/ecf64fa84e55cf8115c49d69cf9a8b6f/3c8ad89af3bd5f77-0a/s2048x3072/d59ad57268f20caac910a41095497f27a760f000.jpg"></figure>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> Please raise your head, Mayoi-san.</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> Hokuto-senpai is yelling at me as well, it's not because of you.</p>
<p>I heard from Koga-san that the reason why Tomoya-san started to call him "Hokuto-senpai" was to get him to listen.</p>
<p>He seems to have a bit of a difficult personality, right? We need to get him to let his guard down first.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Let his guard down, huh... But, how...</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> That's right. Is there anything that Tomoya-san uses regularly when taking care of him?</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Well, there's a blanket on the bed over there, but...</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> I heard that having an item around that carries their smell, or their owner's smell, is calming for animals.</p>
<p>Using that, maybe we can try and see whether we can get Hokuto-senpai to lower his guard?</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> I see...! It's bath time right now, so I'll try to take him to the bathroom with the blanket!</p>
<p>He-here! This way, Hokuto-senpai! It's bath time now&#9834;</p>
<p>Ah, he's walking this way...!</p>
<p>....but, ahh! He completely stopped in his tracks!</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> Hm, it's not going all that well.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> N-no! When I take a step back, he also takes a step forward...! I just can't get any closer to him!</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> That's fine. We can work like this until Koga-san and the others arrive.</p>
<p><b>Mayoi:</b> Yes! Like this, I'll succeed in taking care of Hokuto-senpai properly &#9834;</p>
<p><b>Tatsumi:</b> That's right, keep going, Mayoi-san.</p>
<p><b>Tomoya:</b> ...Ah. Akehoshi-senpai sent me a text.</p>
<p>"Hokuto-senpai's doing just fine~!", it says.</p>
<p>Hm, there's a picture attached too... This is, Ayase-senpai feeding Hokuto-senpai?</p>
<p>I'm glad that Hokuto-senpai seems to be listening to Ayase-senpai seriously...</p>
<p>I have to thank Ayase-senpai properly. Let's get him a nice souvenir before returning home &#9834;</p>

<p><b>Tomoya:</b> ....That aside, why does Ayase-senpai seem to be holding my clothes that should have been in the laundry basket?</p>
