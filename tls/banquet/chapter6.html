<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> …the "aquarium" will close for the day in "30 minutes".</p>
<p>"chief"-san, is there any "exhibition" that we missed?</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Nah, we checked out most of the stuff that I found interesting.</p>
<p>I had fun since you were here to guide me along. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> ufufu. a good way to thank me is through "merchandise"~</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Merchandise..?</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> ahem. "aoumi aquarium" has a fully stocked "merchandise corner", you see.</p>
<p>my "recommendation" is this "kanatee" nuigurumi ♪. it is "popular" due to its soft "feel".</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Well, I don't have any m… huh?</p>
<p>This plushie you put in front of me… This is a "daiou" <sup>[1]</sup> something?</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> it is daiougusokumushi-san.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet6/2.jpg"></figure>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Yup, right, daiougusokumushi.</p>
<p>Since it looks weird and has "great king" in its name, I thought it was a fictional creature.</p>
<p>But if this is bein' sold in the aquarium, it also has to be a sea animal, right?</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> yes~. it is a "crustacean" like "shrimp" and "crabs".</p>
<p>it is displayed near the exit, so i will introduce you on our "way out".</p>
<p>so then, shall we slowly take our leave from the "aquarium"?</p>
<p><blockquote><p>After closing time. In front of Aoumi Aquarium.</p></blockquote></p>

<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> …It's already gotten this dark, huh?</p>
<p>Since summer's ended, it feels like night falls much faster. Looks like today's a full moon-</p>
<p>The clouds are pale, and the moon is faintly floating in the sky. How elegant~♪</p>
<p>It's getting late and I'm getting hungry, so I wanna eat something…</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> but you have "no money"?</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Yup. I can get some food when I get back to the dorm, but it's tough to walk around on an empty stomach…</p>
<p>…Kanacchi, you know any place around here where you can see the sky clearly?</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> how about the "sea"? it is a walkable "distance" from here.</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Sure ♪ That's just the place for a full moon in fall. Let's buy something from a convenience store to eat there.</p>
<p><blockquote><p>Ten minutes later</p></blockquote></p>
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet6/4.jpg"></figure>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Oh. When'd the clouds clear up? How pretty.</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> yes~♪ under "the moon"'s light, the "sea" is glittering and sparkling too ♪</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> I was more so tryin' to praise the full moon, but I guess Kanacchi's only got eyes for the sea.</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> that's because i love the "sea"...♪</p>
<p>even though it's so beautiful, we don't have any "offerings"<sup>[2]</sup> for the moon. what a shame, right?</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> It really is a gorgeous full moon. Anybody would agree.</p>
<p>Since I only had 1,000 yen, I could only get drinks and canned food.</p>
<p>So let's have our banquet watching the sea~.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet6/5.jpg"></figure>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> hehe. it's my first time eating "canned food" on the "beach".</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Same for me. It's pretty shabby though I'm calling it a banquet, but the view's amazing. Not too bad a way to end the day ♪</p>
<p>The sea sure is wide… Just what lies beyond that horizon?</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> the "sea" continues on.</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> And beyond that?</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> there is another "continent".</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Ahah. That's a rather rough explanation of it, huh?</p>
<p>Once again, thanks for today. Even though I was struggling and had no money-</p>
<p>Thanks to Kanacchi, I was able to have fun. At least I spent my time way more productively than if I'd just slept in.</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> i'm happy too, since i was able to convey the appeal of aquariums.</p>
<p>but it might be better if you quit "gambling", you know? haven't you "deeply" understood the importance of "money" now?</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> Ah, I really have been continuously subjected to the pain of poverty. That's why from now on-</p>
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet6/6.jpg"></figure>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> I'm gonna gamble with even more zeal, and make huge profits ♪</p>
<p><strong>Kanata:</strong> ugh. what a handful…</p>
<p><strong>Rinne:</strong> I just can't cut gambling off of me! Since life's a gamble, y'know? Gyahahah.. ☆</p>

<ol class="os-note">
<li>So this is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathynomus_giganteus">Bathynomus giganteus</a>, a giant isopod. It doesn't have a common name in English so I didn't have much to work with… I decided to leave the name as is, and note here that daiou = great king. I hope the confusion is minimal.</li>
<li>Kanata says "月見団子 (tsukimidango)" which is defined as <a href="https://jisho.org/search/tsukimidango">"dumplings offered to the moon (on the 15th day of the 8th month and the 13th day of the 9th month)​"</a>
