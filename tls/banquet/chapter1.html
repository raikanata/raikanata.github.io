<p><b>Kanata:</b> chiaki, good morni~ng &#9834;</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> Good morning! Are you going to eat now too? If it&rsquo;s no problem, shall I prep your meal as well?</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> is that fine?</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> Yup. I was going to start grilling fish just now.</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> hmm? i thought you weren&rsquo;t that "good" at "cooking"?</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> I can make anything that is considered beginner-friendly. I&rsquo;ve already attempted grilled fish once before, so it&rsquo;ll definitely be fine &#9734;</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> is that so~. the trick to making grilled fish is using "strong fire" at a "distance". <sup>[1]</sup> When you do that, the outside becomes "crispy", and the inside becomes "juicy".</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> Strong and distant fire&hellip; Is it far enough right now?</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> yes. let&rsquo;s hold it &ldquo;carefully&rdquo; like this and wait for it to cook &#9834;.</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> while it&rsquo;s cooking, you can&rsquo;t move, right? is there anything i should help with?</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> Well, could you prepare tea and rice for the two of us?</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> got it.</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> chiaki~ do you want a &ldquo;big serving&rdquo; of rice?</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> Yep! A good day starts with a good breakfast, after all. Let&rsquo;s eat lots, and grow big&hellip;&#9734;</p>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> hehe. are we going to keep growing "bigger" as well?</p>
<p><b>Chiaki:</b> I don&rsquo;t mean just getting taller. People are always growing.</p>

<p><b>Chiaki:</b> Let&rsquo;s make sure to live regular lives and eat balanced meals, so that we can continue to grow!</p>

<p><b>Hiyori:</b> C&rsquo;mere, c&rsquo;mere, c&rsquo;mere Bloody Mary! It&rsquo;s breakfast time!</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Eat lots and grow big, okay~?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Since I slept pretty well, I have a good feeling about today. That&rsquo;s good weather &#9834;</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> (snore) zzz&hellip;</p>

<p><b>Rinne:</b> Only a loser of a gambler would run away now! Let&rsquo;s bet all of the money! (mumble)</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Ugh, isn&rsquo;t that a harsh case of sleep talking&hellip;</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Mary, don&rsquo;t grow up to be an adult like Rinne-senpai, okay?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Huh&hellip; Hiyori-chan, did you call for me&hellip;?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> I didn&rsquo;t, I was just amazed at your sleep talking. &ldquo;Gambler&rdquo; this, "bet all of the money" that, it shows a lack of character, no?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Kyahaha. Sleep talking is no sign of character, good or bad.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> You look slovenly&hellip; Is this your day off?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Ah&hellip; There is nothing to do other than to loaf around all day.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> It&rsquo;s all because I believed Kanacchi to be the "god of gambling" the other day that I&rsquo;ve become penniless. <sup>[2]</sup></p>
<figure><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/5a393a7fbfed659f113abafd10da3eed/ce34a79b27d71bd8-53/s2048x3072/8ca887711e413a52119c44019b79448d45461eb8.jpg"></figure>

<p><b>Hiyori:</b> It&rsquo;s all because of that, you say? Isn&rsquo;t Rinne-senpai at fault here, for placing such an importance on Kanata-kun to the point of believing he would truly become lucky at gambling?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> That might be so, but. Hiyori-chan also holds part of the blame.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Since you were the one who told me "Kanacchi seems to have good luck", isn&rsquo;t that right?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> I can&rsquo;t deny it, when you put it that way.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Right? So why don&rsquo;t ya give me some money?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> No, no way! I am not your wallet!</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Then at least lend me some? I&rsquo;ll pay it back two-fold, &lsquo;kay? Hmm? Okay?</p>

</div>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> I am not a bank either, and I can not believe that you will pay it back two-fold.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Hiyori-chan&rsquo;s so stingy~.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> This isn&rsquo;t being stingy. I just don&rsquo;t want to hand over any money without getting anything in return!</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> But if there's something in return? I&rsquo;ll give you my thanks&hellip;&#9734;</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> What is that good for!</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> &hellip;Mary, what&rsquo;s wrong? You became sleepy because your stomach&rsquo;s full now?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Good girl, good girl. Good night, sweet dreams &#9834;</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Dogs sure are living the life. They get called &ldquo;good&rdquo; just for eating and sleeping.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> If Rinne-senpai was as lovely as Mary, I&rsquo;d call him &ldquo;good&rdquo; many times too, but-</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Since this is your one and only life, it&rsquo;s a shame if you don&rsquo;t enjoy it! If you lived all your life just eating and sleeping, I&rsquo;d feel sorry for you.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I gotta have money to enjoy my life though, y&rsquo;know? Soo&hellip;?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Ugh, you&rsquo;re so stubborn! I am not going to give you money.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> But. I have a favor to ask of you, and if you do it, I&rsquo;ll lend you some?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> For real? Alright, if it&rsquo;s something I can do, I will!</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> I want you to pet-sit, in other words, take care of Bloody Mary.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Blamery-chan?&sup3;</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Mhm. Meaning, I want you to take her out for walks.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Both Jun-kun and I have been busy lately, so we&rsquo;ve only been able to play with her within Starmony Hall.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Mary is physically weak, so I can not just take her anywhere I go. So it would be nice if you can make her walk just outside Starmony Hall. Can I ask you to do that?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> It would be good for me too, but. I wonder if Blamery-chan will like me?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Doesn&rsquo;t she get all scared and start trembling whenever someone other than you or Junjun touches her?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> It&rsquo;ll be fine. She only does that when a stranger touches her. She will be calm with Rinne-senpai, since we live in the same room.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Still, be careful when walking her. Like I said, she&rsquo;s physically weak.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I got it. Well then, I&rsquo;ll give it my all.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> So, what about the payment? Up front? Or after? How much will you give?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Of course I will pay after the job is done. This is the norm, you know?</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Oh, also, I want you to take a picture of Mary while on a walk and send it to me as proof, okay?</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> So I&rsquo;ll remain penniless for now. How sad.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> No need to be sad. I&rsquo;ll compensate you generously for taking care of my precious Mary.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Bloody Mary is like my child. Treat her like you would treat me!</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I&rsquo;m looking forward to the compensation, Hiyori-chan.</p>
<p><b>Hiyori:</b> Of course. Well then, I&rsquo;ll be leaving for work now.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> See ya late~r.</p>

<p><b>Rinne:</b> Walks, huh&hellip; He didn&rsquo;t specify what time, but it&rsquo;s not like we can go when Blamery-chan is asleep.</p>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Until Blamery-chan wakes up, I&rsquo;ll go back to bed.</p></div>
<ol class="os-note">
<li>This is a technique for grilling fish called "&#36960;&#28779;&#12398;&#24375;&#28779;". It doesn't seem to have a defined name like that in english, at least that I could find, so I just translated it. Lit. distant and strong flame.</li>
<li>This happened in Rinne's idol story titled "Please, God&#9734;". Associated with <a href="https://ensemble-stars.fandom.com/wiki/(Auspiciousness_and_Gods)_Rinne_Amagi">this card.</a> </li>
<li>Rinne shortens "Bloody Mary" to what reads as "buramea" in Japanese, since the katakana for Bloody Mary reads buraddi meari. Blame-chan unfortunately does not come across the same way in English. Blamery-chan is not the official localisation, but I think it works.</li></ol>
