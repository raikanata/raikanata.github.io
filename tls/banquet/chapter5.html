<p><b>Kanata:</b> we made it~ this is the "aoumi aquarium".</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I was expecting a small place, but this is much larger than I thought.</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> there are many "sea animals" here, after all.</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> since "chief"-san isn't a high school student, it'll be the adult entrance fee.</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Huh!? You're gonna take money for this!?</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> but of course. it costs money to "run" an "aquarium".</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I’ll try and take a look through my wallet, but… I’ve really got no money…</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> -oh?</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> what happened?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> I found a thousand yen bill! I hadn't noticed it ‘cause it was folded!</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Gyahaha, it's extra income! I'm lucky~☆</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> you put it there in the first place, so it doesn't really feel like "extra income"?</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Don't worry about the little things ♪</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Though it'll all go towards the ticket fee soon. How sad…</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Ah, I got it! Kanacchi, can ya wait here for about an hour? I'll double this money playing slots ♪</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> "gambling" again? in that case, there's no "guarantee" that the "money" will increase.</p> 
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet5/2.jpg"></figure>
<p><b>Kanata:</b> there's no other way, huh… since it was me who invited you, this time i will let you in as an "exception".</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Eh, for real? Thank you, Kanacchi ♪</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> but, next time, please pay it back "two-fold".</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> You'll… charge me twice as much, huh? I got excited for nothing…</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> As expected of Mr. Director… Ain't ya too serious about this?</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> ufufu~ i am the "manager" after all.</p> <blockquote>Inside Aoumi Aquarium </blockquote><p><b>Rinne:</b> ...</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> how's your first "aquarium", "chief"-san?</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> ...</p> 
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet5/3.jpg"></figure>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> If I'm being honest… I didn't have a good impression of the place called an "aquarium".</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> hm? what made you think that way?</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I found it pitiable to take animals from the sea where they lived freely, and close them in this small space. So I'd been avoiding them for some reason.</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> But that may have been just prejudice, or a preconception.</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> So I accepted Kanacchi's offer to confirm the truth with my own eyes.</p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> and now, has your "impression" changed even just a bit?</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Well. I don't comprehend all of it yet, but I get that aquariums aren't just "freak shows".</p> 

<p><b>Kanata:</b> yes. "aquariums" have a number of "social" roles.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> aquariums spread information, and "educate" people about the "conservation of species" that protects lives.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> they do "research" to extend the lifespans of sea animals. they are also a place of "recreation" to enrich your heart.<sup>[1]</sup></p> 
<p><b>Kanata:</b> you can have fun in an "aquarium", while learning about these things.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> and your fun memories will forever stay with you…♪</p> 
<p><b>Rinne:</b> I see. I'm real glad I came here to see it for myself.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> fufu. i'm also glad that i invited you here.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> …Hey, Kanacchi. You got sea anemones here?</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> of course. they're in the "petting corner" there, so you can also touch them if you want.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> do you like "sea anemones"?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> I've been told I look like one when I put my hair up. I'd never seen one outside of pictures before, so I thought I should see them now ♪</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> hmm. i think "chief"-san looks like a "sea slug".</p> 
<figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet5/4.jpg"></figure>
<p><b>Rinne:</b> Sea slug… Is that the kind of slug with all sorts of colors?</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> yes. a sea slug has "all sorts of colors" to give off a warning to those who get too close.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> isn't that just like your "image" of seeming dangerous?</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> also, sea slugs spend nearly all their time eating and sleeping.</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> in that aspect too, they're just like you doing nothing but eating and sleeping on your days off ♪</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Gyahaha. I merely had an impression of the sea-dwelling slugs, but… I started to feel a kinship after you put it that way ♪</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> in that case, let me introduce you to the "sea anemones" first, and then the "sea slugs".</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> since there are more than "3000 kinds" of sea slugs…</p> <p><b>Kanata:</b> if we look for it, we might find one that is exactly like "chief"-san…♪</p>
