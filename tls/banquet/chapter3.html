Good girl...♪</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> The walking must've made her hungry, she's really goin' at it.</p><figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet3/1.jpg"></figure><p><b>Rinne:</b> Seeing Blamery-chan eat so eagerly got me hungry too. Should I get something from the kitchen...?</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> A few minutes later. At Starmony Hall’s Kitchen</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> I don't want a hassle, so I'll just get cup noodles.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> I'm grateful I can just freely eat from the instant noodles stock. I'm not starving, thanks to that.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> ...Hmm? There's an appetizing smell coming from the kitchen.</p><p><b>Niki:</b> ♪~♪~♪</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Hey, great timing!</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Uwah, Rinne-kun!?</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> I missed you, Niki ☆</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Uu, I didn't miss you at all, though....</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> You're actin' like you crossed paths with a jinx. <sup>[1]</sup></p><p><b>Niki:</b> Well, aren't you one? Most of the troubles I get mixed up in are thanks to Rinne-kun.</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Especially if you're saying something like "great timing", I gotta put my guard up.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Gyahaha, you praise me too much♪</p><p><b>Niki:</b> I was not praising you at all!</p><p><b>Niki:</b> I'm busy making fried rice for lunch, so please go somewhere else!</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> C'mon, don't be so heartless. While you're at it, I just want you to make some food for lil old me as well.</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Really〜?</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Oioi, when have I ever lied to you before?</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Many times! So many that I lost count!</p><p><b>Niki:</b> But, well. A chef can't ignore someone who comes to them hungry, so I guess I can cook for you.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Ah, that's what makes ya Niki ☆</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Well, I'm in a good mood.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Lend me some money, while you're at it ♪</p><p><b>Niki:</b> No way!</p><p><b>Niki:</b> I'm not "at" something like that right now, also!?</p><p><b>Niki:</b> And did you lose all of your money gambling again?

His answers won't help anyone, and he'll just be a bad influence if anything.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Don't say bad things like that to other people, and stop spreading rumors.</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Though it's not a rumor but a fact...</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Then go ahead and tell us.

My belly's touchin' my back, so please hurry.</p><p><b>Niki:</b> I just finished it now.</p><p><b>Niki:</b> Shinkai-kun, would you like, would you like to eat too?</p><p><b>Kanata:</b>i already ate "outside", so it is alright.</p><p><b>Kanata:</b> then, i'll go put my stuff in the "room" and be right back.</p><figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet3/5.jpg"></figure><p><b>Kanata:</b> ehehe. let's get along well today, "chief"-san.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> Mhm.
