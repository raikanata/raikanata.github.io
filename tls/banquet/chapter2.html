<p><b>Rinne:</b> Blamery-chan, where do you wanna go?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Okay-okay, that way. I guess that’s the park.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Blamery-chan, everything OK? Can you keep walking?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Don’t push yourself, alright? I’ll pick you up when you’re tired, and we’ll go back.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Look at me, walking the dog leisurely on a weekday. How peaceful…</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> HaHa~♪ Take a look, Yuu-chan! It’s Gambler-oniisan, walking a dog~!</p> <figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet2/1.jpg"></img></figure><p><b>Yuta:</b> Really. Isn’t that a Yorkshire Terrier? Doesn’t suit him at all.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Hello, Rinne-senpai ♪ What’s with the little one? Don’t tell me you kidnapped it?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> I have a reason, y’know. I’m pet-sitting.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Huh, like a side-job?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> It’s not really a side job. Hiyori-chan tasked me with walking his dog, basically.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Oop- Because Yuta-kun put his hand out, Blamery-chan hid behind me.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Eh? Is it my fault?</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> We’re not scary, y’know? C’mere, c’mere~♪</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Like Hiyori-chan said, she gets scared and starts trembling if someone she doesn’t know reaches out.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> But she’s all lovey dovey with me since we live in the same room. Right, Blamery-chan?</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Ahaha, look at her face. It’s like she’s saying “We’re not that close.”~.</p> <figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet2/2.jpg"></img></figure><p><b>Yuta:</b> But being feared by a dog who likes Rinne-senpai just fine, it's giving me mixed feelings…</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> HiHi~♪ Don’t feel bad, Yuu-chan. She was only scared because she “met you for the first time”.</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> When we aren’t strangers to her anymore, I’m sure we will get along too~.</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> Gambler-oniisan, is her name “Blamery”?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Nope. That’s what I call her, but her name’s Bloody Mary.</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> HuHu~♪ Bloody Mary, got it!</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> Nice to meet you, Bloody Mary! Sora is Sora Harukawa, and this is Sora’s friend Yuuchan~</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> Sora and Yuuchan both played “Werewolf Game” together with Dazzling-oniisan<sup>[1]</sup> before. You might feel scared now, but I’d be happy if we can become friends little by little~</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Ah, Blamery-chan is sniffing Sora-chan’s hand. Looks like she’s taken an interest in ya.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Amazing. When we started living together, she kept her distance from me, and would only barely look at me.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> It’s like Sora-kun understands the things that animals want to say, huh.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Eh, for real?</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> For real, yeah. He interpreted a cat for me before.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Interesting. I want to try talking with an animal for once too.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Me too. I wonder what kind of stuff they normally think about.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Huh? Rinne-senpai, I think a sound came from your phone just now.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Oh, it’s a message from Hiyori-chan.</p><p><b>Rinne:</b> “Take a picture while on the walk!”...I almost forgot about that.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Picture?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Yup. It’s proof that I’m doing the pet-sitting properly.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Blamery-chan, c’mere~ Say cheese…☆</p> <figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet2/3.jpg"></img></figure><p><b>Rinne:</b> Ugh, it came out blurry.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> But still, it’s obviously a picture of Blamery-chan, so… Sent.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Hmm? Another reply came.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> “It’s not cute, redo!”, huh? He’s a client with many orders.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Alright Blamery-chan, pay attention to me~☆</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Ahaha, no picture will be good enough for him, you know~♪</p> <figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet2/4.jpg"></img></figure><p><b>Rinne:</b> It’s hard to photograph animals, though. Yuta-kun, give it a try.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Alright~. Sora-kun, could you tell Bloody Mary that we want to take a picture of her?</p> <p><b>Sora:</b> HeHe~♪</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Okay, say cheese…☆</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Take a look, it looks pretty good.</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Ah, that’s cheating, Yuta-kun.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Not true~. Nobody told me I can’t ask Sora-kun for help.</p> <p><b>Yuta:</b> Hey, Rinne-senpai, why don’t you try again like this now?</p> <p><b>Rinne:</b> Alright. Blamery-chan, look at me, pretty please♪</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b>...♪</p> <p><b>Jun:</b> Ohii-sama, what’s got you smirking at your phone like that?</p> <figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet2/5.jpg"></img></figure><p><b>Hiyori:</b> I’m not “smirking like that”, I am smiling!</p> <p><b>Jun:</b> Doesn’t change much either way.</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> No, they are completely different!</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> “Smirking” is an expression that Ibara makes, and “Smiling” is an expression that Nagisa-kun makes!</p><figure><img src="https://raikanata.github.io/img/posts/themescout/banquet/banquet2/6.jpg"></img></figure><p><b>Jun:</b> When you put it that way…</p> <p><b>Jun:</b> I got it. I’ll say it the correct way.</p> <p><b>Jun:</b> So, what is it that’s making you smile? Did something good happen?</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> I’d asked Rinne-senpai to take Mary on a walk. I just got a picture from him!</p> <p><b>Jun:</b> …Huh? Isn’t that Harukawa-kun in the picture?</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> Rinne-senpai is the one taking the picture, so he’s not in it. Looks like he’s with Sora-kun and Yuta-kun right now.</p> <p><b>Jun:</b> Hmm… In any case, isn’t it pretty unexpected that you’d ask that guy to do this~?</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> I gave him a job in exchange for money. This is a noble’s duty, and I think he can manage since it’s just walking.</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> Since I know him, I knew that there was a chance he would slack off.</p> <p><b>Hiyori:</b> It’s good that he seems to be taking his job seriously…♪</p>
