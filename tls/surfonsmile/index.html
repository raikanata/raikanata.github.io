				<p>I only want to make you smile, that&rsquo;s my Message</p>

<p>Even if today doesn&rsquo;t go as expected</p>
<p>These things happen, right, Days go by</p>
<p>So why don&rsquo;t you try and embrace your freedom more?</p><br>
<p>The waves hit the shore anyway, the heart is a Surfrider</p>
<p>I want the splashes of your popping smile</p>
<p>Anything you don&rsquo;t like, blame it on me, forget about it</p>
<p>Riding the waves of music, I&rsquo;ll make it come true, My Hope</p><br>
<p>Since you came here, go with the flow of your emotions, &lsquo;cause</p>
<p>A feeling of having been reborn, isn&rsquo;t it nice?</p><br>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think this is just a momentary escape from reality</p>
<p>Tomorrow is a new day, and its wind I will Blow at you*</p>

<p>If I seem selfish, please forgive me</p><br>
<p>Anyway, whatever I try to say</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m afraid you might take it in a bad way</p>
<p>But, it&rsquo;s definitely better to have that moment of happiness in your heart, right?</p><br>
<p>So I only want to make you smile, that&rsquo;s my Message</p>
